# WeatherDataScrape
A simple web scraper to extract weather data from a website


These three scripts go to a weather website and scrape data from it. I have deleted the website url from the files and this script won't work for another site but was just a nice side project I had. I'm hoping to update this to a publicly availble website so othe rpeople can follow along.
